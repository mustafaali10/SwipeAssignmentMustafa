Hello Team Swipe!

I've completed the given assignment i.e to use the API link to GET and POST

This folder also contains the apk file which could be transferred to the desired phone and can be runned !

To run this Project

1) Launch Android Studio
2) Click File -> Open
3) Navigate to the Project location 
4) Click on the SwipeAssignmentbyMustafa foler which has an Android Logo with it and then click OK
5) Connect your phone using Wireless Connect or simply by connecting your phone to the laptop using cable 
6) When you see your device name in the device section click on Play Button 
7) Done !


TWO MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE DONE 
1) To Add Logo of the Product
2) Refine SearchView and update the list after one search

We'll figure and improve that out in the future as my Internal Exams are scheduled from 16 May 2023 that's why left it out as future improvements 😅

Hope to get Selected !

Thanks and Regards
